# Stage 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. **Geographic Influence on Employee Participation**

- **Insight:**  
  Most employees participating in the program are from `city_103`, suggesting that this city may have better access to career development initiatives or training programs.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Expand efforts to engage employees from underrepresented cities by improving program accessibility or creating localized initiatives tailored to their needs.

### 2. **Gender Imbalance Among Employees**

- **Insight:**  
  The majority of employees participating in the program are male, indicating a potential gender gap in participation or career development opportunities.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Create inclusive training campaigns and introduce initiatives tailored to address career growth for women, fostering gender equity within the organization.

### 3. **Relevance of Prior Work Experience**

- **Insight:**  
  Most employees in the program have relevant prior work experience, indicating a preference for upskilling rather than onboarding new hires.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Design advanced training modules for experienced employees while also offering foundational tracks for employees transitioning to new roles.

### 4. **Educational Background as a Factor**

- **Insight:**  
  A majority of employees have bachelor’s degrees, with a smaller proportion holding master’s degrees and very few holding PhDs. This suggests that the program appeals more to early and mid-career professionals.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Develop tailored training initiatives for bachelor’s and master’s degree holders, focusing on career progression and upskilling opportunities.

### 5. **Dominance of STEM Backgrounds**

- **Insight:**  
  Employees from STEM disciplines form the majority of participants, showing that technical roles find the program particularly valuable.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Offer more specialized training tracks in technical areas while exploring new programs for non-STEM employees to ensure inclusive career development opportunities.

### 6. **Varied Levels of Work Experience**

- **Insight:**  
  Employees participating in the program have diverse levels of experience, with a significant proportion having over 20 years of work experience.

- **Insight:**  
  Most employees come from small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), indicating a higher demand for skill development in these organizations.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Develop specialized programs for SMEs or form strategic partnerships with these organizations to meet their specific training needs.

### 8. **High Interest Among Private Sector Employees**

- **Insight:**  
  The private sector accounts for most employee participation, reflecting a strong interest in career development opportunities among these workers.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Focus on creating skill enhancement programs specifically designed for private sector employees to maximize engagement and impact.

### 9. **Frequent Job Changes Indicate High Career Mobility**

- **Insight:**  
  Many employees have recently changed jobs or have a history of frequent transitions, indicating high career mobility.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Introduce programs designed to support employees in career transitions, such as cross-functional training or emerging market specialization.

### 10. **Class Imbalance in Target Variable**

- **Insight:**  
  The target variable is imbalanced, with most employees not actively seeking new jobs (`target = 0`). This presents challenges in building predictive models.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Apply balancing techniques (e.g., oversampling or undersampling) during model training to improve performance. Focus on understanding key factors driving employees to seek new opportunities (`target = 1`).
