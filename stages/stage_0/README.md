## Business Metrics

To measure the success of the objectives, the following metrics are used:

1. **Attrition Prediction Accuracy**  
   Measures the accuracy of the model in predicting whether an employee will leave the company. This is calculated as the percentage of correct predictions over the total dataset.

2. **Attrition Rate by Education Level or Major Discipline**  
   The percentage of employees leaving the company categorized by their education levels or major disciplines.

3. **Average Training Hours vs. Attrition**  
   Compares the average training hours of employees who left the company with those who stayed.
